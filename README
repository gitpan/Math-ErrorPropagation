Statistics::ErrorPropagation version 0.01
=============================

DESCRIPTION

A function f({X_i}) of a set of n independent stochastic variables 
{X_i}={X_0, X_1, ..., X_(n-1)}
with means {x_i}={x_0, x_1, ..., x_(n-1)}
and corresponding variances {var_i}={var_0, var_1, ..., var_(n-1)}, 
has mean f({x_i}) and a variance var_f which is the sum 
of the squared partial derivatives multiplied by the variances 

var_f  = (df/dx_i)**2 var_i

This package allows the propagation of errors on the variables through
various simple mathematical operations to automatically compute the error of 
the function. Use it to define  data each with a central (mean) value and 
either the variance or standard deviation (square root of the variance), 
then apply perl's mathematical operators to them to calculate your function 
f. These operators are overloaded so that f automatically has the correct
variance.
